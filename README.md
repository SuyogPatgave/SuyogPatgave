I am a data analyst with a focus on data-driven approaches to provide business, financial, and technical solutions and insights. I have collaborated in performing end-to-end analysis on topics such as Large Language Model Security (a comprehensive risk analysis project), network analysis with graph theory, data mining, natural language processing, and more.

I am interested in undertaking real-world challenges, exploring multiple analytical techniques, and continuously honing my skills through practical projects.

Feel free to reach out to me through email or LinkedIn.

(PS: I will keep my profile updated with the latest developments and projects------ stay tuned!)
