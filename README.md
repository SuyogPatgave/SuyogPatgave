## Hi there 👋, I'm Suyog!
### A data analyst just with a foot shy of being a data scientist!


I am interested in solving complex problems and provide data-driven solutions with statistical significance. I am currently exploring different methodologies to solve real-world problems while expanding my knowledge across domains like business, finance, and NLP.

I am willing to collaborate with analysts, creators, and developers—basically anyone who needs assistance not just with data-driven strategies and actionable insights but to create something new. I am an avid learner and an explorer, not withheld to any stream of thoughts—always open and curious.

### 🛠️Skills R / Python / SQL / Excel / Tableau / Power BI
