I am interested in solving complex problems to provide data-driven solutions with statistical backing and proven significance. I am currently exploring practical ways to solve real-world problems while expanding my knowledge across domains like business, finance, and NLP.
My tool kit contains R, Python, SQL, Excel, Tableau, and Power BI.
I am willing to collaborate with analysts, creators, and developersâ€”basically anyone who needs assistance not just with data-driven strategies and actionable insights but to create something new. I am an avid learner and an explorer, not withheld to any stream of thoughtsâ€”always open and curious.

Skills: R / Python / SQL / Excel / Tableau / Power BI
